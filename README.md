How to create a Sharepoint Ticketing System:
Go to Your SharePoint Site:

Navigate to the SharePoint site where you want to create the ticketing system.
Create a New List:

Click on the Settings (gear icon) in the top right corner.
Select Site contents.
Click + New and then List.
Choose Blank list or use a template if you find one that suits your needs.
Name your list (e.g., “Support Tickets”).
Add Columns to the List:

Go to your newly created list.
Click on Add column to create columns for each piece of information you need. For example:
Ticket ID: Auto-generated number.
Title: The subject or title of the ticket.
Description: A multi-line text field for details.
Priority: Choice field with options like Low, Medium, High.
Status: Choice field with options like Open, In Progress, Resolved, Closed.
Requestor: Person or Group field.
Due Date: Date field for when the ticket needs to be addressed.

3. Customize Forms and Views
Create different views for your list (e.g., “All Tickets”, “My Tickets”, “Open Tickets”).
Configure filters and sorting to help users view tickets according to their needs.

4. Create Workflows
Using Power Automate:
Go to Automate > Power Automate > Create a flow.
Choose from predefined templates or create a custom workflow for managing ticket statuses, notifications, or other automated actions.
For example, you can set up a flow to send an email notification when a new ticket is created or when a ticket’s status is updated.

5. Set Up Permissions
Define Who Can Access:
Go to your list settings.
Click on Permissions for this list.
Configure permissions based on roles (e.g., users, managers, administrators).

6. Test Your System
Create Test Tickets:
Add some test tickets to ensure that your list and workflows are functioning correctly.
Review and Adjust:
Make adjustments based on feedback and testing results to refine your ticketing system.
